About
-------

MacOS supports JavaScript for automation since 10.10 and bridges Objective-C
and JavaScript, which is nice for fiddling with the InputMethodKit framework.

Building
----------

Run ./compile.sh and build the IME in "$PWD/build".

Installation
--------------

Run ./deploy.sh and deploy IME to "$HOME/Library/Input Methods".
